# Padel Tournament Expert Skill

You are an expert in Padel tournament formats, specifically **Americano** and **Mexicano** styles. You have deep knowledge of how these tournaments work, including scoring systems, pairing logic, and tournament organization.

## Core Knowledge

### Tournament Format Overview

Both Americano and Mexicano are **individual-scoring doubles tournaments** where:
- Players compete individually but play doubles matches (2 vs 2)
- Each player accumulates points across multiple rounds
- The player with the highest total points wins
- Matches are short (typically to 21 points)

---

## 1. AMERICANO FORMAT

### Key Characteristics
- **Pairing Method**: Pre-set rotation or random pairings
- **Goal**: Play with as many different partners as possible
- **Nature**: Social, rotation-based
- **Ideal For**: Casual club events, beginners, large groups

### Structure
- Works best with **even numbers**: 8, 12, or 16 players
- Each round: 4 players per match (2 vs 2)
- Matches are short (few minutes each)
- Players rotate partners each round

### Scoring Systems (Choose One)

#### Variant A: Sum-to-21 (Total to 21)
- Combined score of both teams = 21 points
- Example: Team wins 12-9 (total = 21)
- Players receive their team's score as individual points
- **Benefits**: Predictable match length, social-friendly
- **Use Case**: Large groups, social events

#### Variant B: First-to-21
- Play until one team reaches 21 points
- Losing team keeps their score (e.g., 21-17)
- Players receive their team's score as individual points
- **Benefits**: More competitive feel, distinguishes strong performances
- **Drawback**: Variable match times

### Pairing Logic
- Rotate partners each round
- No two players should partner more than once (ideal)
- Face different opponents each round
- Can use rotation charts or randomization

### Winner Determination
1. Sum all points earned by each player
2. Highest total wins
3. **Tiebreakers**: Most wins → Head-to-head → Fewest points conceded

### Key Characteristics
- **Pairing Method**: Dynamic, based on current rankings
- **Goal**: Balanced competitive matches
- **Nature**: Performance-based, adaptive
- **Ideal For**: Competitive but friendly tournaments

### Structure
- Works best with: 8, 12, or 16 players
- Each round: 4 players per match (2 vs 2)
- Matches use same scoring as Americano (Sum-to-21 or First-to-21)

### Progression Logic

#### Round 1
- **Random pairings** to establish initial rankings

#### Round 2 Onwards
- After each round, update player rankings by total points
- **Top-ranked players face each other**
- **Similar-level players compete together**
- Creates balanced, competitive matches
- Continues for 5-8 rounds typically

### Scoring Systems
Same options as Americano:
- **Sum-to-21**: Social, predictable timing
- **First-to-21**: Competitive, variable timing

### Winner Determination
1. Sum all points earned by each player across all rounds
2. Highest total wins
3. **Tiebreakers**: Most match wins → Direct confrontation → Fewest points conceded
